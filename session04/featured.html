                        Iconic for its red cap with white warts, this species is often depicted in folklore and art.
                        Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete fungus of
                        the genus Amanita. It is a large white-gilled, white-spotted mushroom typically featuring a
                        bright red cap covered with distinctive white warts. It is one of the most recognisable fungi in
                        the world. 

                        A muscaria exhibits complex genetic diversity that suggests it is a species complex rather than
                        a single species. It is a widely distributed mushroom native to temperate and boreal forests
                        of the Northern Hemisphere, now also naturalised in the Southern Hemisphere, forming symbiotic
                        relationships with various trees and spreading invasively in some regions.

                    <p> Its name derives from its traditional use as an insecticide. It can cause poisoning, especially
                        in children and those seeking its hallucinogenic effects, due to psychoactive compounds like
                        muscimol and the ibotenic acid; however, fatal poisonings are extremely rare. Boiling it reduces
                        toxicity by removing water-soluble ibotenic acid into the discarded water. Drying converts
                        ibotenic acid into muscimol, lowering toxicity but retaining psychoactive effects. Some cultures
                        use it as food after preparation. Indigenous peoples of Siberia used A. muscaria as an inebriant
                        and entheogen. It has been controversially linked to Santa Claus, Viking berserkers, Vedic soma,
                        and early Christianity, though evidence is sparse and disputed. Its rise in the 2020s as a legal
                        hallucinogen alternative has led to Food and Drug Administration scrutiny.

                        A. muscaria has appeared in art and literature since the Renaissance, becoming iconic in fairy
                        tales, children’s books, and media like the Super Mario games and Disney’s Fantasia. It has also
                        influenced literary depictions of altered perception—most notably in Alice’s Adventures in
                        Wonderland—and has been referenced in novels by writers including Oliver Goldsmith, Thomas
                        Pynchon, and Alan Garner.
