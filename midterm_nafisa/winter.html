                <h1>Sakura: Japan's Cherished Cherry Blossoms</h1>
                <section>
                    <h2> Winter-flowering Cherry </h2>
                    <p>
                        A few years ago a trend began for planting early or late-flowering (depending on your point of
                        view) Japanese cherries as street trees, and in some parts of town two closely related
                        cultivars, like craft beer outlets, seem to be popping up on every street corner. Look out for
                        the white flowered Prunus × subhirtella ‘Autumnalis*’ and the pink flowered Prunus × subhirtella
                        ‘Autumnalis Rosea’
                    </p>
                    For the uninitiated, the sight of cherry blossom in the depths of winter has been known to elicit
                    strong reactions, from concern for seasons going haywire, to global warming incarnate. But, although
                    I wouldn’t want to deny the very real climate change phenomena for which overwhelming evidence
                    exists, the winter-flowering cherry could not in itself be defined as an indicator. It’s supposed to
                    flower in mild weather from November through to April. And this season, trees in London have been
                    particularly good, blooming consistently since November despite the see-sawing of temperatures
                    within the space of a few days. So, despite it feeling wintry out there, there has not, until last
                    week been a sustained cold patch and this appears to have been exactly what this tree likes.

                    <h2>Facts </h2>
                    <p>why does the winter-flowering cherry flower in winter? The short answer is it has been bred
                        to, its flowers are not filling an environmental niche to take advantage of a winter flying
                        bee, it’s flowering because humans wanted something to cheer them up during the gloomy
                        winter months. Prunus × subhirtella is thought to have Japanese horticultural origins, but
                        it has been around for so long, its provenance disappears into the mists of time. It is
                        sometimes also called Prunus subhirtella – note: no ‘×’ denoting hybridity – it’s unclear
                        (as with many other ornamental cherries) what parent species have hybridised to create our
                        tree. Sometimes too, it is called Prunus pendula, an appellation most commonly ascribed to
                        another cultivar, the spring-flowering weeping Higan cherry. This though seems to be
                        sloppiness and it should properly be called Prunus × subhirtella ‘Pendula Rosea’. Something
                        else to look out for in Winter Flowering cherries is the last flush of blooms appearing in
                        April with the leaves. These flowers differ from those of previous waves in having stalks –
                        winter blooms are stalkless (or sessile).

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Interestingly one of the world’s oldest Cherries, the 1,000 year-old ‘Miharu Takizakura’
                        in Fukushima province, is a weeping Higan and is often claimed to be the ‘most beautiful
                        cherry tree in Japan’. This is a cultivar unknown as a London street tree, but it may
                        bode well for the longevity of the trees we do have, not to mention their long term
                        potential for craggy good looks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As spring approaches, Winter-flowering cherries will be competing with other early flowering
                        Prunus species, particularly the widely planted purple cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera) of either
                        the ‘Pissardii’ (white blossom) and ‘Nigra’ (pink blossom) cultivars. If you’re lucky, you may
                        see almond (Prunus dulcis) with big pink flowers, blireana plum (Prunus × blireana), with almost
                        fluorescent pink blossom or another Japanese tree, Prunus × incamp ‘Okame’ again with pink
                        blossom preceded by distinctive maroon coloured buds.
