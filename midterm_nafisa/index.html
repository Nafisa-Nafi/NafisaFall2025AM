                <h1>Sakura: Japan's Cherished Cherry Blossoms</h1>

                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        The cherry blossom, or sakura, is the flower of trees in Prunus subgenus Cerasus. Sakura usually
                        refers to flowers of ornamental cherry trees, such as cultivars of Prunus serrulata, not trees
                        grown for their fruit (although these also have blossoms). Cherry blossoms have been described
                        as having a vanilla-like smell, which is mainly attributed to coumarin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wild species of cherry tree are widely distributed, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. They are
                        common in East Asia, especially in Japan, where they have been cultivated, producing many
                        varieties.

                    <h2>Classification</h2>
                    <p>
                        Classifying cherry trees is often confusing, since they are relatively prone to mutation and
                        have diverse flowers and characteristics, and many varieties (a sub-classification of species),
                        hybrids between species, and cultivars exist. Researchers have assigned different scientific
                        names to the same type of cherry tree throughout different periods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Europe and North America, ornamental cherry trees are classified under the subgenus Cerasus
                        ("true cherries"), within the genus Prunus. Cerasus consists of about 100 species of cherry
                        tree, but does not include bush cherries, bird cherries, or cherry laurels (other non-Cerasus
                        species in Prunus are plums, peaches, apricots, and almonds). Cerasus was originally named as a
                        genus in 1700 by de Tournefort. In 1753, Linnaeus combined it with several other groupings to
                        form a larger Prunus genus. Cerasus was later converted into a section and then a subgenus, this
                        system becoming widely accepted, but some botanists resurrected it as a genus instead. In China
                        and Russia, where there are many more wild cherry species than in Europe, Cerasus continues to
                        be used as a genus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Japan, ornamental cherry trees were traditionally classified in the genus Prunus, as in
                        Europe and North America, but after a 1992 paper by Hideaki Ohba of the University of Tokyo,
                        classification in the genus Cerasus became more common. This means that (for example) the
                        scientific name Cerasus incisa is now used in Japan instead of Prunus incisa.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Hanami" is the many centuries-old practice of holding feasts or parties under blooming sakura
                        (桜 or 櫻; さくら or サクラ) or ume (梅; うめ) trees. During the Nara period (710–794), when the custom is
                        said to have begun, it was ume blossoms that people admired. By the Heian period (794–1185),
                        however, cherry blossoms were attracting more attention, and 'hanami' was synonymous with
                        'sakura'. From then on, in both waka and haiku, "flowers" (花, hana) meant "cherry blossoms," as
                        implied by one of Izumi Shikibu's poems. The custom was originally limited to the elite of the
                        Imperial Court but soon spread to samurai society and, by the Edo period, to the common people
                        as well. Tokugawa Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the
                        sakura trees, people held cheerful feasts where they ate, and drank sake.

                        Since Japan was modernized in the Meiji period, the Yoshino cherry has spread throughout Japan,
                        and it has become the main object of hanami. Various other cultivars were cut down one after
                        another during changes related to the rapid modernization of cities, such as the reclamation of
                        waterways and the demolition of daimyo gardens. The gardener Takagi Magoemon and the village
                        mayor of Kohoku Village, Shimizu Kengo, were concerned about this situation and preserved a few
                        by planting a row of cherry trees, of various cultivars, along the Arakawa River bank. In Kyoto,
                        Sano Toemon XIV, a gardener, collected various cultivars and propagated them. After World War
                        II, these cultivars were inherited by the National Institute of Genetics, Tama Forest Science
                        Garden and the Flower Association of Japan, and from the 1960s onwards were again used for
                        hanami.

                        Every year, the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the public track the sakura zensen
                        ("cherry blossom front") as it moves northward up the archipelago with the approach of warmer
                        weather, via nightly forecasts following the weather segment of news programs. Since 2009,
                        tracking of the sakura zensen has been largely taken over by private forecasting companies, with
                        the JMA switching to focus only on data collection that than forecasting. The blossoming begins
                        in Okinawa in January and typically reaches Kyoto and Tokyo at the beginning of April, though
                        recent years have trended towards earlier flowerings near the end of March. It proceeds
                        northward and into areas of higher altitude, arriving in Hokkaido a few weeks later. Japanese
                        locals, in addition to overseas tourists, pay close attention to these forecasts.

                        Most Japanese schools and public buildings have cherry blossom trees planted outside of them.
                        Since the fiscal and school years both begin in April, in many parts of Honshu the first day of
                        work or school coincides with the cherry blossom season. However, while most cherry blossom
                        trees bloom in the spring, there are also lesser-known winter cherry blossoms (fuyuzakura in
                        Japanese) that bloom between October and December.
