                    <h2> Blooming Season</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many cherry species and cultivars bloom between March and April in the Northern Hemisphere. Wild
                        cherry trees, even if they are the same species, differ genetically from one individual to
                        another. Even if they are planted in the same area, there is some variation in the time when
                        they reach full bloom. In contrast, cultivars are clones propagated by grafting or cutting, so
                        each tree of the same cultivar planted in the same area will come into full bloom all at once
                        due to their genetic similarity.
                    </p>

                            Some wild species, such as Edo higan and the cultivars developed from them, are in full
                            bloom
                            before the leaves open. Yoshino cherry became popular for cherry-blossom viewing because of
                            these characteristics of simultaneous flowering and blooming before the leaves open; it also
                            bears many flowers and grows into a large tree. Many cultivars of the Sato-zakura group,
                            which
                            were developed from complex interspecific hybrids based on Oshima cherry, are often used for
                            ornamental purposes. They generally reach full bloom a few days to two weeks after Yoshino
                            cherry does

                    <h2>Impacts of climate change</h2>
                    <p>
                        The flowering time of cherry trees is thought to be affected by global warming and the heat
                        island effect of urbanization. According to the record of full bloom dates of Prunus jamasakura
                        (Yamazakura) in Kyoto, Japan, which has been recorded for about 1200 years, the time of full
                        bloom was relatively stable from 812 to the 1800s. After that, the time of full color rapidly
                        became earlier, and in 2021, the earliest full bloom date in 1200 years was recorded. The
                        average peak bloom day in the 1850s was around April 17, but by the 2020s, it was April 5; the
                        average temperature rose by about 3.4 °C (6.1 °F) during this time. According to the record of
                        full bloom dates of the Yoshino cherry in the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., the bloom date
                        was April 5 in 1921, but it was March 31 in 2021. These records are consistent with the history
                        of rapid increases in global mean temperature since the mid-1800s.

                            Japanese cherry trees grown in the Southern Hemisphere bloom at a different time of the
                            year.
                            For example, in Australia, while the trees in the Cowra Japanese Garden bloom in late
                            September
                            to mid-October, the Sydney cherry blossom festival is in late August.

                            There's an escalating concern of climate change as it poses a threat to sakura cultivars,
                            given
                            that they are highly susceptible to shifts in temperature and weather fluctuations. The
                            changes,
                            driven by climate change including warmer temperatures and earlier starts to springtime, may
                            disrupt the timing of their blooms and potentially lead to reduced flowering and cultural
                            significance.

                            In 2023, it has been observed in China that cherry blossoms have reached their peak bloom
                            weeks
                            earlier than they previously had a few decades ago. Similarly, data from Kyoto, Japan, and
                            Washington, D.C., United States, also indicated that blooming periods are occurring earlier
                            in
                            those locations as well.

                            Although precise forecasting is generally challenging, AI predictions from Japan
                            Meteorological
                            Agency, have suggested that without substantial efforts to rein in climate change, the
                            Somei-Yoshino cherry tree variety could face significant challenges and even the risk of
                            disappearing entirely from certain parts of Japan, including Miyazaki, Nagasaki, and
                            Kagoshima
                            prefectures in the Kyushu region by 2100.

                    <h2>Cultivars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Japan has a wide diversity of cherry trees, including hundreds of cultivars.By one
                        classification method, there are more than 600 cultivars in Japan,[while the Tokyo
                        Shimbun claims that there are 800.[64] According to the results of DNA analysis of 215 cultivars
                        carried out by Japan's Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in 2014, many of the
                        cultivars that have spread around the world are hybrids produced by crossing Oshima cherry and
                        Prunus jamasakura (Yamazakura) with various wild species.Among these cultivars, the
                        Sato-zakura Group and many other cultivars have a large number of petals, and the representative
                        cultivar is Prunus serrulata 'Kanzan'.

                        <p>
                            The most popular cherry blossom cultivar in Japan is 'Somei-yoshino' (Yoshino cherry). Its
                            flowers are nearly pure white, tinged with the palest pink, especially near the stem. They
                            bloom
                            and usually fall within a week before the leaves come out. Therefore, the trees look nearly
                            white from top to bottom. The cultivar takes its name from the village of Somei, which is
                            now
                            part of Toshima in Tokyo. It was developed in the mid- to late-19th century, at the end of
                            the
                            Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji period. The 'Somei-yoshino' is so widely
                            associated
                            with cherry blossoms that jidaigeki and other works of fiction often show the trees being
                            cultivated in the Edo period or earlier, although such depictions are anachronisms.


                            Prunus × kanzakura 'Kawazu-zakura' (Kawazu cherry) [ja], a representative cultivar of the
                            cold
                            season that blooms from late February to early March in Japan
                            ''Prunus'' × ''kanzakura'' 'Kawazu-zakura' [ja] is a representative cultivar that blooms
                            before
                            the arrival of spring. It is a natural hybrid between the Oshima cherry and Prunus
                            campanulata
                            and is characterized by deep pink petals. Wild cherry trees usually do not bloom in cold
                            seasons
                            because they cannot produce offspring if they bloom before spring, when pollinating insects
                            become active. However, it is thought that 'Kawazu-zakura' blooms earlier because Prunus
                            campanulata from Okinawa, which did not originally grow naturally in Honshu, was crossed
                            with
                            the Oshima cherry. In wild species, flowering before spring is a disadvantageous feature of
                            selection; in cultivars such as 'Kawazu-zakura', early flowering and flower characteristics
                            are
                            preferred, and they are propagated by grafting.

                            Cherry trees are generally classified by species and cultivar, but in Japan they are also
                            classified using names based on the characteristics of the flowers and trees. Cherry trees
                            with
                            more petals than the ordinary five are classified as yae-zakura (double-flowered sakura),
                            and
                            those with drooping branches are classified as shidare-zakura, or weeping cherry. Most
                            yae-zakura and shidare-zakura are cultivars. Famous shidare-zakura cultivars include
                            'Shidare-zakura', 'Beni-shidare', and 'Yae-beni-shidare', all derived from the wild species
                            Prunus itosakura (syn, Prunus subhirtella or Edo higan).

                            The color of cherry blossoms is generally a gradation between white and red, but there are
                            cultivars with unusual colors such as yellow and green. The representative cultivars of
                            these
                            colors are ''Prunus serrulata'' 'Grandiflora' A. Wagner (Ukon) [ja] and ''Prunus serrulata''
                            'Gioiko' Koidz (Gyoiko) [ja], which were developed in the Edo period of Japan.

                            In 2007, Riken produced a new cultivar named 'Nishina zao' by irradiating cherry trees with
                            a
                            heavy-ion beam. This cultivar is a mutation of the green-petaled ''Prunus serrulata''
                            'Gioiko'
                            (Gyoiko) [ja]; it is characterized by its pale yellow-green-white flowers when it blooms and
                            pale yellow-pink flowers when they fall. Riken produced the cultivars 'Nishina otome'
                            (blooms in
                            both spring and autumn, or year-round in a greenhouse), 'Nishina haruka' (larger flowers),
                            and
                            'Nishina komachi' ('lantern-like' flowers that remain partially closed) in the same way.

                    <p>In the present day, ornamental cherry blossom trees are distributed and cultivated worldwide.
                        While flowering cherry trees were historically present in Europe, North America, Philippines,
                        and China,the practice of cultivating ornamental cherry trees was centered in
                        Japan, and many of the cultivars planted worldwide, such as that of Prunus ×
                        yedoensis,have been developed from Japanese hybrids.

                            The global distribution of ornamental cherry trees, along with flower viewing festivals or
                            hanami, largely started in the early 20th century, often as gifts from Japan.
                            However, some regions have historically cultivated their own native species of flowering
                            cherry
                            trees, a notable variety of which is the Himalayan wild cherry tree Prunus cerasoides.</p>
