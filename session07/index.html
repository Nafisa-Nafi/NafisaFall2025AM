					<h2>What is <em>Ramaria</em>?</h2>
					<p>
						<em>Ramaria</em> is a large genus of coral fungi in the family Gomphaceae. Instead of having a
						classic cap
						and stem, these mushrooms grow as branching structures that look like tiny pieces of underwater
						coral.
						Scientists estimate that there are around two hundred species in the genus, showing colors that
						range from
						pale cream and bright yellow to orange, pink, tan, and even purple.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many species form dense clusters on the forest floor. Some are edible, such as the yellow
						species
						<em>Ramaria flava</em> and <em>Ramaria aurea</em>, while others are mildly poisonous and can
						cause stomach
						upset. The mix of edible, inedible, and toxic species is one reason why coral fungi are
						beautiful to look at
						but tricky to identify confidently.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="habitat">
					<h2>Habitat & Forest Partnerships</h2>
					<p>
						Most <em>Ramaria</em> species live in temperate forests around the world. They are mycorrhizal
						fungi, which
						means they form a partnership with tree roots. The fungus helps trees absorb water and nutrients
						from the
						soil, and in return the trees share sugars made through photosynthesis. These partnerships can
						happen with
						both broadleaf trees like beech and oak and with conifers such as fir and hemlock.
					</p>
					<p>
						Coral fungi often appear on the ground in leaf litter, sometimes in small clusters and sometimes
						scattered
						across the forest floor. Some species are known as “snowbank fungi,” because they fruit along
						the edges of
						melting snow in spring. Others grow from buried pieces of wood or along old, hidden logs,
						forming lines of
						mushrooms that trace where the wood is breaking down.
					</p>

				<section id="dye">
					<h2>Ramaria as a Natural Dye</h2>
					<p>
						Artists and dyers are especially interested in <em>Ramaria</em> because certain species can be
						used to make
						soft, earthy colors on wool, silk, and linen. The <a
							href="https://www.mushroomcoloratlas.com/mushroom/ramaria/" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer">
							Mushroom Color Atlas</a> shows how fresh coral fungi can produce gentle greys and buttery
						yellows when
						combined with different metal mordants such as iron, alum, or tin.
					</p>
					<p>
						These mushrooms are quite sensitive in the dye pot. They only give good color when they are very
						fresh, and
						the temperature has to stay on the lower side so that the colors do not dull or turn flat grey.
						Dyed
						samples from the atlas reveal a surprising range: iron can deepen the shade toward smoky grey,
						while alum
						and other mordants can shift the yellows slightly warmer or cooler. Even though the palette is
						subtle,
						coral fungi add a beautiful, natural feel to fabric and watercolor pigments.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="safety">
					<h2>Safety, Edibility & Look-alikes</h2>
					<p>
						Because many coral fungi look similar, mushroom experts warn that <em>Ramaria</em> species
						should be
						treated with caution. Some, like <em>Ramaria botrytis</em>, are eaten in certain regions, but
						others, such
						as <em>Ramaria formosa</em>, are reported as poisonous and can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
						and
						stomach pain. Even species described as “edible” may cause reactions in sensitive people.
					</p>
					<p>
						For this reason, <strong>this page is for learning and dye inspiration only</strong>, not for
						foraging
						advice. If you are interested in collecting coral fungi, it is important to work with local
						mycological
						societies, follow regional field guides, and avoid tasting any wild mushroom unless an
						experienced expert
						has identified it.
