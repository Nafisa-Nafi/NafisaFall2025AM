        <p>Matsutake mushrooms, botanically classified as Tricholoma matsutake, is a rare, wild, and edible Japanese
            fungi that belong to the Tricholomataceae family. Translating to mean “pine mushroom” in English, Matsutake
            mushrooms grow under debris on the forest floor by specific varieties of pine trees, fir trees, oak trees,
            and tanoak trees. There are two closely related species in North America, Tricholoma magnivelare and
            Tricholoma murrillianum, and these mushrooms are also labeled as Matsutake in the marketplace. Matsutake
            mushrooms are only found in the wild as their symbiotic relationship with the roots of the trees cannot be
            recreated in cultivation. Due to their limited quantities and waning habitat in Japan from disease,
            Matsutake mushrooms are a highly prized variety in China, Japan, and Korea, fetching extremely high prices
            for their unusual spicy aroma and taste.</p>
        <blockquote>
            Matsutake mushrooms are small to medium in size, averaging 5-20 centimeters in diameter, and have rounded,
            convex caps that flatten out with age and are connected to thick, stout stems. The smooth, dry cap is white
            with distinct curled edges when young and develops brown scales and spots when mature. Underneath the cap,
            there are many tan to white notched, attached gills that are shielded by a partial, cotton-like veil when
            immature. The broad stem is firm, solid, and dense, averaging 4-15 centimeters in length, and has a brown
            and white, two-toned appearance. Matsutake mushrooms are known for their unusual cinnamon and pine aroma,
            and when cooked, they have a crunchy, toothsome texture with a pungent, spicy flavor.
